# Phishing Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect phishing domains and webpages targeting specific organizations using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Datasets for training and evaluation
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and prototyping
- `models/` - Saved machine learning models
- `src/` - Source code for data processing, feature extraction, and model training

## Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Place your datasets in the `data/` folder.
- Use the notebooks in `notebooks/` for data exploration and model development.
- Store trained models in the `models/` directory.
- Core source code lives in `src/`.
